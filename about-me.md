# Bhagavan Bollina

Security Engineer - Cloud 

Bhagavan Bollina, aka xcriminal, a hacker and security aficionado. He is a passionate security researcher who loves hacking and breaking things on the cloud. Parallelly he also dabbles in web, network and mobile security. Bhagavan is a core member of the cloud security R&D and testing team at Appsecco. His enthusiasm for cloud security has led him to do multiple community speaking engagements at null meetups and conferences.

He loves writing and teaching which he does through his various blog posts and internal sessions with various teams. He also enjoys cracking cloud CTFs, finding bugs with popular software online and reporting them via responsible disclosure and trying out new services in the cloud to see if they have holes in them.

When not building and breaking stuff in the cloud, he enjoys bug bounty hacking and CTFs. He loves training his dog as well in his spare time, but the dog weirdly seems to not like cloud security.
